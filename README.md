This repo contains most of the bCASH ecosystem contracts and automated test files used in testing. These contracts have not been audited, and should be used for educational purposes only. 

```yarn test``` to launch test, you can also only trigger test for a particular file if you want (you should)

```yarn``` to install all dependencies

```cp .env.example .env``` and adapt the .env, you only need the PRIVATE_KEY. make a burner wallet for this, just in case you commit by mistake but .env is in the .gitignore
